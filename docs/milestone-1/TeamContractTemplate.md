## Receiving feedback

- A:
  - "Hey Liam, the homepage commit isn’t quite aligned with what I envisioned. Would you be open to brainstorming some adjustments together to incorporate both our ideas?"
  - "No problem! If it was a quick change, I can revise it easily. If it was a 10-hour task, though, that’s another story."
- B:
  - "Hey Eric, I think we could improve the main page. I found an alternative approach—would you be open to trying it?"
  - "That sounds good! As long as you have a solid improvement plan, I’m open to it."

## In case of conflict

If a team member is unresponsive, does not contribute equally, disregards feedback, or fails to collaborate effectively, the following steps will be taken:

Initial Resolution: Direct, one-on-one discussion to address the issue.
Escalation: If the issue persists, the concern will be brought to the instructor for mediation.
