# Project Name Goes Here

A project README, especially when hosted on GitHub, is the first landing point for anyone viewing your project. It should explain the following:

- What your project is for
  - Why it exists
  - What problem(s) it solves
- How to use your project
  - How to install project dependencies
  - How to run the project
  - How to test the project code
- Rules for contributing to your project

Your team will continuously update this README as your project takes shape over the course of the semester.
